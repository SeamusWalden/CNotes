Write snippets of C code in your txt files for notes and skip the hassle of compiling and running.
Greatly helps organization and note-taking to make sure you do not miss anything.

Simply just run either the CNotes (Linux) or CNotes.exe (Windows) and specify file name as an argument and it will look through and create the program for you.

Works with functions, structs, and whatnot more

Everything will be sorted and put into the main function as needed, so no need to define it yourself
See Example.txt for more examples

Built to skip around that process of having multiple terminals open and a txt file for editing notes. This should streamline the process and help you take better notes.
