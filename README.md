Write snippets of C code in your txt files for notes and skip the hassle of compiling and running.

Simply just run either the CNotes (Linux) or CNotes.exe (Windows) and specify file name as an argument and it will look through and create the program for you.

Works with functions, structs, and whatnot more

Example:

~{

int sum_func(int x, int y){
	return x + y;
}

int x = 5;
int y = 26;
int total = sum_func(x, y);

printf("%d", total);

}~

Everything will be sorted and put into the main function as needed, so no need to define it yourself
See Example.txt for more examples

Include support and more coming soon!
